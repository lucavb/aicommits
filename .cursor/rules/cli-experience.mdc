### CLI Experience

- Use `@clack/prompts` for interactive flows
- Provide clear, helpful error messages and guidance
- Support both interactive and non-interactive modes
- Offer conventional CLI patterns and comprehensive `--help`
- Keep prompts minimal and focused; fail fast with actionable messages
