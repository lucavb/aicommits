# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a new subcommand to the existing `agent` command that enables automatic creation of GitHub Pull Requests using the GitHub API or CLI. The subcommand will analyze the differences between a base branch and head branch, automatically populate PR templates with relevant information about the changed files, and create a well-structured pull request with AI-generated descriptions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a GitHub PR directly from the command line with auto-populated templates, so that I can streamline my workflow and ensure consistent PR descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `aicommits agent pr` THEN the system SHALL create a new GitHub pull request
2. WHEN creating a PR THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the base and head branches
3. WHEN creating a PR THEN the system SHALL populate the PR template with information about changed files
4. IF a PR template exists in the repository THEN the system SHALL use it as the base structure
5. WHEN the PR is created THEN the system SHALL provide a link to the newly created PR

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PR description to include intelligent analysis of the file changes, so that reviewers can quickly understand what was modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing file changes THEN the system SHALL identify all files modified between base and head branches
2. WHEN generating the PR description THEN the system SHALL categorize changes by file type or functionality
3. WHEN generating the PR description THEN the system SHALL use AI to create meaningful summaries of the changes
4. WHEN multiple files are changed THEN the system SHALL group related changes together
5. IF configuration files are changed THEN the system SHALL highlight these changes prominently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify custom base and head branches for the PR, so that I can create PRs between any branches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides `--base` option THEN the system SHALL use the specified base branch
2. WHEN the user provides `--head` option THEN the system SHALL use the specified head branch
3. IF no base branch is specified THEN the system SHALL default to the main/master branch
4. IF no head branch is specified THEN the system SHALL use the current branch
5. WHEN invalid branch names are provided THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview the PR content before creation, so that I can review and modify it if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating PR content THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the title and description
2. WHEN previewing THEN the user SHALL be able to edit the title and description
3. WHEN previewing THEN the user SHALL be able to cancel the PR creation
4. WHEN the user confirms THEN the system SHALL proceed with PR creation
5. IF the user cancels THEN the system SHALL exit without creating the PR

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle GitHub authentication automatically using GitHub CLI, so that I don't need to manually configure API tokens each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a PR THEN the system SHALL verify that GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed
2. IF GitHub CLI is not installed THEN the system SHALL display installation instructions and exit
3. WHEN GitHub CLI is installed THEN the system SHALL check authentication status using `gh auth status`
4. IF GitHub CLI is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prompt user to run `gh auth login` and exit
5. WHEN authenticated THEN the system SHALL use `gh auth token` to obtain the authentication token for API calls
6. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and resolution steps
